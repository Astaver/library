# library
personal library project for adding books and toggling a read status. HTML/Javascript/CSS

User can access a html form on page to add a book. A html card is then generated allowing the user to toggle a read status or delete the book.

This is a work in progress. The skeleton works but the CSS has not been polished. The read status is superficial at the moment, needs to be adjusted
in the prototype constructor.

Currently no way to save file. Need to add local save functionality.
